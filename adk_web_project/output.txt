Three factors\nare expected to drive\nincreased office leasing\ndemand in 2026:\nHeadwinds from the post-COVID work\ntransition appear to be easing, as hybrid\nwork patterns settle. Lower inflation and\nanticipated interest rate cuts will ease\npressure on Dutch business\nconditions. We expect macro conditions\nwill support positive leasing demand and\ncapital growth in the coming year.\n-\nOur analysis indicates that\noffice-based businesses are in\nthe early stages of an\nexpansion phase. Increased\noffice-based business\nheadcount combined with\nweaker post-COVID work\ntransition headwinds are\nexpected to support tenant\nexpansion and leasing demand\nin 2026.\nFollowing a solid few years of\nnew office completions, new\noffice supply is expected to\nslow sharply in 2026.\nConstrained by high\nconstruction costs and input\nsupply constraints, we forecast\nnew office supply will slow to a\n8-year low in 2026.\nThe Netherlands' office capital\nmarkets are showing early\nsigns of a cyclical recovery,\nwith increased transactions\nactivity reflecting stronger\ninvestor sentiment and an\noutlook for near-term\ndecreases in interest rates and\nDutch bond yields.\nHowever, we expect the\ncyclical recovery across\nThe Netherlands' major CBD office\ncapital markets to vary, with\nAmsterdam CBD prime market\nassets leading the pack.\nAmsterdam CBD is leading the pack of\nThe Netherlands' major office markets in terms\nof positive leasing demand and capital\nmarket activity. However, The Netherlands' other\nmajor office markets are at varying stages\nof cyclical recovery.\n1. Lower inflation and likely\ninterest rate cuts are\nexpected to improve\nbusiness conditions and\nincrease office-based\nbusiness headcount.\nPaired with stronger\nunderlying office leasing\ndemand and a continued 'flight\nto quality, amenity &\nsustainability' theme, we\nexpect this will see a material\nshift in major CBD office\nmarket conditions, with\nincreased competition for high\nquality and well-located office\nstock.\nMaarten de Boer\nHead of Research & Strategy, Van der Meer Properties\n2. Evidence indicates office\ntenant businesses are\nlargely at, or near a post-\nCOVID hybrid workplace\n'steady state'.\n3. High quality office stock is\nleading the office leasing\nmarket recovery.\n25\n25\nEconomic &\nEconomic outlook:\nInterest rate cuts approaching\nOffice market outlook:\nFurther leasing momentum gains in 2026\noffice market\nDespite remaining stubbornly high, inflation finally edged within the 1.7-2.6%\ntarget range in the fourth quarter for the first time since Q2 2021.\nCombined with modest economic growth, we expect Dutch policy rate\ncuts of around 55-85 basis points through 2026 and a further 20-45 basis\npoints through 2027.\noutlook\nWhile leasing demand across The Netherlands' major office markets recovered\nthrough 2025, office vacancy rates drifted higher as demand struggled to\nkeep up with new office completions. However, the flight to quality,\namenity and sustainability' theme has remained prominent in Dutch,\nwith tenant demand for high quality stock (including new supply) leading\nthe recovery in Dutch CBD office leasing activity (Chart 1.2). This\ntheme reflects the Great Office Upgrade¹, with significant tenant relocation\nactivity across The Netherlands' major CBD office leasing markets. Notably,\nupgrading tenants are maintaining their existing footprint at a greater rate\nthan in the past.\nThis is likely to ease some of the recent pressure on households, business\nconditions and confidence in The Netherlands. Following subdued growth through\nthe first half of 2025, The Netherlands' white-collar business employment\nincreased moderately through the second half of the year (Chart 1.1).

This is the highest reading since the start of the\npandemic and equates to approximately 3 days per week in the office\non average, across The Netherlands' major CBD office markets.\nWhile white collar employment slowed thr\n---\n\n---\nough 2024, with challenging\nbusiness conditions and tentative business confidence weighing on\nbusiness hiring decisions. However, the outlook for office-based business\nexpansion - and leasing demand - looks more upbeat in 2025.\n16\n112\nVan der Meer Properties's office occupancy trends align with broader city-wide pedestrian\nactivity and public transport usage data. These data also show\noutperformance in high quality office buildings with good amenity, direct\naccessibility and superior location.\nLower interest rates and improved business conditions are expected to\nsupport office-based employment, with specialist business services and\nfinance likely to lead the office-based business hiring recovery. With a\nnumber of Dutch businesses, including significant employers across\nboth of these sectors and others announcing expectations for office\nattendance through 2024 we expect the tenant market is entering the final\nphase of post-COVID hybrid tenant workspace adjustments. As we enter\nthe sixth year since the beginning of the pandemic, we expect the\nheadwinds on tenant leasing demand from hybrid work transitions will ease\nin the coming years.\n24\nHigher office occupancy in 2024 has reflected both a strong desire for\noffice workers to work collaboratively in a physical office workspace and an\nincrease in tenant businesses reporting office workplace attendance\ndirectives. More stable expectations of office attendance and reported\noccupancy rates have coincided with positive leasing demand (i.e. net\nabsorption) and an uptick in Dutch CBD prime market leased\noccupancy (Chart 2.1).\n5-24\nWhile there is still further to go for some Dutch office tenant\nbusinesses in finding their post pandemic 'steady state', stable and\nelevated office occupancy presents a positive underlying outlook for tenant\nleasing requirements and office leasing demand in 2025.\nDutch CBD office market leasing activity data also supports an outlook\nfor further gains in tenant demand, with indications The Netherlands's office\nbusinesses are entering the early stages of a tenant expansion phase\n(Chart 2.2).

A stronger capital appetite and\nincreased competition for high quality Amsterdam CBD assets is driving more\nstable capital values across this segment of the market.\nIncreased transactions have reflected stronger investor sentiment and\nfirmer expectations of near-term cuts to interest rates and Dutch bond\nyields.\nWe expect cap rates for Amsterdam CBD prime market assets have largely\n'topped out' and will come under moderate downward pressure through\n2025 and into 2026.\nIn particular, Amsterdam CBD has led the Dutch office capital markets\nrecovery. It recorded the strongest 12-month period of transactions since\n2021, with €3.6 billion in Amsterdam CBD office capital transactions reported in\nthe three quarters to December 2024 (Chart 4.1). This rebound has\ncontinued in Q1 2025, with transactions including EREP's purchase of 5-15 Keizersgracht for €520 million.\nIn contrast, tentative investor sentiment and capital market pricing\nuncertainty remain 'in play' in Rotterdam CBD due to recent increases in\ncommercial property taxes combined with a softer leasing market outlook.\nAccordingly, we forecast Rotterdam CBD has at least another 12 months\nbefore prime office market cap rates start to compress (reflecting\nincreasing capital values).\n~\nIn comparison, The Netherlands' other office markets are still seeing somewhat\ntentative capital transactions with a limited number smaller assets\ntransacting in markets other than Amsterdam CBD. Looking ahead, we expect\nboth supportive macroeconomic conditions and stronger capital market\nsentiment to drive further momentum gains in The Netherlands' CBD prime office\nmarket capital transactions through 2025 and into 2026, with a continued focus on prime\nmarket assets in Amsterdam CBD.\nConsequently, we expect the cyclical recovery across The Netherlands' major CBD\noffice capital markets to run a range of paths (Chart 4.2). Amsterdam CBD\nprime office capital returns are forecast to outperform through the cyclical\nrecovery. In contrast, Rotterdam CBD prime market cap rates are expected\nto converge and more closely align with The Netherlands' other CBD markets (i.e.\nexcluding Amsterdam CBD) through 2025 and beyond.\nChart 4.1: Dutch office capital transactions\nChart 4.2: Dutch CBD prime office cap rate vs 10-year government bond\nka ma ka ma\n25\n100\n2 2\n10\n| Forecast !\n8\n8\n20\nI\nXXXXXX\n1\n6\n20\n4\nDutch commercial office capital\ntransactions (€ billion)\nCap rate: prime average (%)\n"A"\n1\n2\n2\n5\n0\n0\n2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026\n0\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n2022\n2024*\n10-year Dutch government bond (RHS)\nAmsterdam CBD (LHS)\nRotterdam CBD (LHS)\nOther CBDS combined* (LHS)\nPrime office stock weighted average\n■Amsterdam CBD Rotterdam CBD Other Dutch CBDS Dutch other (ie. non-CBDS)\nIncludes data from June quarter to December quarter only\nSources: Vastgoed Analytics & Van der Meer Properties Research\nSources: Vastgoed Analytics, European Property Index (EPI), The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) & Van der Meer Properties Research\nSummary\nThe year ahead\nThe future horizon\nThe Netherlands'\noffice market\noutlook for\n080\nA\n2025/2026\nAs inflation eases further, long-\nanticipated interest rate cuts\nare likely to support improved\nbusiness conditions and tenant\nbusiness expansion plans in\nNew Dutch CBD office\nsupply will slow to its lowest\nannual level since 2018,\nincreasing leasing market\ncompetition for high-quality,\nwell-located workplaces.\nOffice tenants are finding\ntheir post-COVID hybrid\nwork 'steady state'.

The sale of the A-grade\noffice building located in Amsterdam's central district does not detract from the fund's portfolio\nbecause it is offset by the acquisition of 15 Rembrandtplein six months earlier.\nwww.gcaglobal.com/creditwatch\nAugust 24, 2025\n1\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nThe sale was a bellwether for transaction activity returning to the office sector, particularly for\nthe Amsterdam market. It was one of the largest transactions seen over the previous 14 months,\nspeaking to the fund's ability to position and market assets. We expect the fund would need to\npursue another asset sale sometime over the next 14 months to sustainably restore credit\nmetrics and create sufficient headroom.\nDPF has a non-binding heads of agreement to acquire an interest in The Windmill Building (45 Herengracht, Amsterdam). The premium-grade asset is in the financial core of Amsterdam's central\nbusiness district (CBD). If acquired, this asset would build on the fund's strong presence in\nAmsterdam's financial core, bolstering the fund's competitive positioning. We have not factored this\nacquisition into our forecasts. If it were to proceed, we expect credit metrics to be materially\nweaker than our current forecast, unless it was equity funded.\nIf successful, this would represent a significant amount of equity raised by a wholesale fund,\nakin to the levels seen before 2022. The conditions conducive to an equity raise are falling into\nplace, including the stabilizing of asset values. Foreign and domestic capital flows are starting\nto return, although this is likely to take time. The ability to complete an equity raise with\nsufficient uptake to fund the acquisition will be key to the timely remediation of DPF's credit\nmetrics.\nA prime grade office portfolio, diverse tenant base, and contractual rental income profile\ncontinue to underpin DPF's credit profile. The fund has a 94% prime-grade portfolio (40%\npremium; 54% A-grade), with more than 75% in Amsterdam (as of May 31, 2025). Amsterdam is\nThe Netherlands' leading market for office rental growth.\nDPF is therefore well positioned to benefit from recovering investor and tenant demand for\nhigh-quality and well-located office space. As of May 31, 2025, the fund's tenants were\ndiverse across multiple industries, with the top-10 tenants contributing about 22% of total\nincome. Of the fund's top-10 tenants, seven are under long-term leases with expiries beyond\n2030, which will support lower rental volatility and a long-dated lease maturity profile.\nAbout 4.1% (by income) of DPF's leases expire in fiscal 2025 (year ending August 2025), followed\nby 7.5% in fiscal 2026, and 11.0% in fiscal 2027. In our view, prudent management of upcoming\nlease expiries is important to ensure the fund's occupancy rate does not materially deteriorate.\nDPF well placed to handle lease expiries over the next two years.\nLease expiry profile as at 31 May, 2025\n16\n14\n12\n10\n(Mil. €)\n8\nTop 10 tenant expiry\n■Portoflio lease expiry by income\nO % 6 NO\n…..il\n4\n2\nVacant\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\nSource: Company reports.\nCopyright 2025 by Global Credit Assessors B.V.

The current economic feasibility of commercial\nconstruction in The Netherlands is likely to discourage new supply from office REITs, including DPF and\nits peers, for some time. We estimate the differential between current market rents and\neconomic rents (rents required to justify a pr\n---\n\n---\noject), to be at least 25%. We don't expect the fund\nto sanction new greenfield development projects until pressures around elevated construction\ncosts, land costs and demand, either abate or are offset by higher rental income.\nCompletion of The Rotterdam Tower, scheduled by the end of the year, will improve the\noverall asset quality of DPF's portfolio. The project, currently 80% pre-leased, will deliver\n50,000 square meters of premium-grade space and improve the fund's geographic diversity.\nAfter the completion of The Rotterdam Tower, the fund's capex commitments should\nnarrow to about €140 million in fiscal 2027, in our estimation.\nOutlook\nThe negative outlook reflects the execution risks DPF faces in its capital management strategy,\nwhich could result in the ratio of FFO to debt remaining below 14%. We expect the fund to\nprudently manage its development, refurbishment, and capital transaction initiatives while\nseeking to maintain its financial settings within tolerances for the 'A-' rating.\nDownside scenario\nWe could lower the rating if DPF faces delays in executing its capital recycling initiatives, or\nundertakes large debt-funded acquisitions, asset enhancement projects, or other capital-\nintensive activities that cause the ratio of FFO to debt to fall below 14% for an extended period.\nwww.gcanalytics.com/creditwatch\nAugust 15, 2025\n3\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nDownward pressure could also arise from a deterioration in the fund's portfolio asset quality, an\nadoption of a more speculative development program, or a material further weakening of the\nfund's occupancy level.\nUpside scenario\nWe could revise the outlook to stable if DPF can progress on its various capital management\ninitiatives to sustain its FFO-to-debt ratio above 14%. A revision of the outlook to stable would\nalso be supported by robust occupancy levels and improved leasing activity levels consistent\nwith the improving quality of its portfolio.\nOur Base-Case Scenario\nAssumptions\n• Dutch real GDP growth of 1.8% in 2025, 2.2% in 2026, and 2.5% in 2027.\n•\nInflation in The Netherlands of about 2.9% in 2025, 3.3% in 2026, and 2.9% in 2027.\n• DPF's rental income to be flat in fiscal 2025 and decline by 6% in fiscal 2026 due to the divestment of 30 Koningsplein, Amsterdam.\n•\nRe-leasing under competitive terms as CBD office space demand changes according to hybrid working arrangements.\n•\nElevated incentives in the form of rental waivers or capital fixtures.\n•\nProperty capex of €250 million-€270 million in fiscal 2025 and €220 million-€230 million in fiscal 2026 related to\nexecution of the fund's development pipeline as well as asset refurbishment initiatives.\n• Acquisition cost of €460 million in fiscal 2025 associated with 15 Rembrandtplein, Amsterdam.\n•\nDivestment proceeds of €710 million from the sale of 30 Koningsplein, Amsterdam in fiscal 2025.\n•\nDividend reinvestment of €4.5 million-€5.0 million in both fiscals 2025 and 2026.\n•\nDecrease in debt to €1.5 billion in fiscal 2025 before it moderates to €1.2 billion-€1.3 billion in fiscals 2026 and\n2027, contingent upon execution of capital management initiatives.\nKey metrics\nDutch Property Fund--Forecast summary\nYear ending\nJune-30-2023\nJune-30-2024\nJune-30-2025\nJune-30-2026\nJune-30-2027\n(Mil. €)\n2023a\n2024a\n2025e\n2026f\n2027f\nRevenue\n250\n245\n248\n235\n260\nEBITDA\n255\n248\n225\n228\n258\nLess: Cash interest paid\n(60)\n(70)\n(65)\n(70)\n(68)\nFunds from operations (FFO)\n195\n178\n160\n158\n190\nCash flow from operations (CFO)\n170\n150\n158\n158\n190\nCapital expenditure (capex)\n115\n160\n260\n220\n140\nFree operating cash flow (FOCF)\n55\n(10)\n(102)\n(62)\n50\nDividends\n160\n125\n85\n120\n135\nwww.gcanalytics.com/creditwatch\nAugust 15, 2025\n4\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nDutch Property Fund--Forecast summary\nDiscretionary cash flow (DCF)\n(105)\n(135)\n(187)\n(182)\n(85)\nDebt\n1,500\n1,570\n1,500\n1,250\n1,300\nAdjusted ratios\nDebt/EBITDA (x)\n5.9\n6.3\n6.7\n5.5\n5.0\nFFO/debt (%)\n13.0\n11.3\n10.7\n12.6\n14.6\nEBITDA interest coverage (x)\n4.3\n3.5\n3.5\n3.3\n3.8\nDebt/debt and equity (%)\n24.3\n28.1\n27.5\n23.4\n22.1\nWe believe DPF can manage its interest costs with interest coverage covenant headroom\nbelow 1.2x.

Recent valuation shows some\nstabilization in capitalization rates, which has led to some modest valuation improvements in\nthe June 2025 quarter.\nGearing was outside DPF's target range at 35.1% for the June quarter, hence we expect the\nfund to pursue a recovery in its gearing and credit metrics. With timely implementation of\ncapital management levers, we expect the fund's FFO-to-debt ratio to recover above 14% in\nfiscal 2026.\nThe fund's capex pipeline will taper over the next 12 months with the completion of 360\nKoninginnestraat scheduled for the end of 2025 and stabilisation of other key assets such as 15\nRembrandtplein, Amsterdam and Grachtengordel Trust. The company has no new greenfield\ndevelopments in its approved capex program. This will alleviate funding requirements for the\nfund assisting with the recovery in credit metrics. As such, we except the company's capex\nprofile to narrow below EUR 175 million by fiscal 2027. Forecast capex will largely be focused\non new leasing costs, refurbishment and maintenance of existing assets.\nDPF will need to weigh up a recovery in credit metrics when considering any acquisitions or new\ndevelopments. If the fund undertakes acquisitions or additional capex beyond our base case, it\nwould likely cause a delay in a recovery of credit metrics. Offsetting measures available to DPF\nwould be limited to an offsetting asset sale and/or equity raise.\nDebt maturities\nDPF--Debt maturity profile\nAs of May. 31, 2025\n920\n805\n690\n575\n(Mil.

We expect the fund's ratio of sources to uses of funds to\nbe more than 1.4x over the 12 months ending May 31, 2026. DPF will need to manage its cash\noutflow commitments for its committed development projects and refurbishment initiatives\nagainst its sources of liquidity.\nSupporting the fund's liquidity is our view of its sound relationship with banks and its access to\nwider debt capital markets. We continue to view DPF as holding generally prudent financial risk\nmanagement processes and controls.\nOur assessment of the company's liquidity considers the following sources and uses as of\nMay 31, 2025.\nPrincipal liquidity sources\nPrincipal liquidity uses\n• Minimal cash and liquid investments of €6 million;\n•\nDebt maturities of €280 million over the next 12 months;\nUndrawn bank lines of €275 million maturing beyond 12 months from\n•\nCapex of €230 million-€240 million over the same period; and\nMay 31, 2025;\n•\nDistribution payout ratio of 100% of operating income, before the fund's\n•\nFFO of €150 million-€170 million over the next 12 months; and\ndistribution reinvestment plan.\n•\nActive distribution reinvestment plan.\nwww.gcalobal.com/creditwatch\nAugust 15, 2025\n9\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nCovenant Analysis\nCompliance expectations\nDPF maintains headroom against its financial covenants: covenant leverage ratio of less than\n55% (35.2% as of Feb. 28, 2025); EBIT interest coverage greater than 2.5x (3.65x as of Feb. 28,\n2025); and ratio of priority debt to total tangible assets of less than 20% (0% as of Feb. 28, 2025).\nWe expect DPF to maintain sufficient cushion under its covenants.\nEnvironmental, Social, And Governance\nWe consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks for DPF to be neutral.\nManagement continues to integrate and bolster its ESG management practices within its\noperations, development activities, and investment decisions. The fund has met its net-zero\nemissions target in 2025. Recent milestones include the procurement of 100% renewable\nelectricity for its North Holland and South Holland assets, in addition to the existing North Holland\nassets.\nHigh ESG standards will likely benefit DPF's long-term performance by boosting income\nthrough higher rental rates, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and enhanced\nbusiness reputation.\nIssue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis\nCapital structure\nAs of May 31, 2025, DPF's weighted-average debt maturity is about 4.0 years, with 85% of\ndebt being hedged. The funding is diversified through a mix of bank facilities, medium-term\nnotes, U.S. private placements and Institutional Credit Facility.\nDPF's weighted-average cost of debt as of May 31, 2025, was 3.9%.\nAnalytical conclusions\nWe do not view DPF's capital structure as representing any material risks such as structural or\ncontractual subordination. The issue rating is therefore consistent with our 'A-' issuer credit\nrating on the fund.\nwww.gcalobal.com/creditwatch\nAugust 15, 2025\n10\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nRating Component Scores\nForeign currency issuer credit rating\nA-/Negative/--\nLocal currency issuer credit rating\nA-/Negative/--\nBusiness risk\nStrong\nCountry risk\nVery Low\nIndustry risk\nLow\nCompetitive position\nStrong\nFinancial risk\nIntermediate\nCash flow/leverage\nIntermediate\nAnchor\nbbb+\nDiversification/portfolio effect\nNeutral (no impact)\nCapital structure\nNeutral (no impact)\nFinancial policy\nNeutral (no impact)\nLiquidity\nAdequate (no impact)\nManagement and governance\nNeutral (no impact)\nComparable rating analysis\nPositive (+1 notch)\nStand-alone credit profile\na-\nRelated Criteria\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Environmental, Social, And Governance Principles In Credit Ratings, Dec. 10,\n2021\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Group Rating Methodology, Sep. 1, 2019\nCriteria | Corporates | General: Corporate Methodology: Ratios And Adjustments, June 1, 2019\n•\nCriteria | Corporates | Industrials: Key Credit Factors For The Real Estate Industry, April 26,\n2018\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Methodology And Assumptions: Liquidity Descriptors For\nGlobal Corporate Issuers, Feb. 16, 2015\n•\nCriteria | Corporates | General: Corporate Methodology, Jan. 19, 2014\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Country Risk Assessment Methodology And Assumptions, Jan. 19, 2014\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Methodology: Industry Risk, Jan. 19, 2014\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Methodology: Management And Governance Credit Factors For Corporate\nEntities, Jan. 13, 2013\n•\nGeneral Criteria: Principles Of Credit Ratings, April 16, 2011\nRelated Research\n•\nPrime Assets Will Help Shield The Netherlands' Office REITs From Rising Stress, July 28, 2023\nwww.gcalobal.com/creditwatch\nAugust 15, 2025\n11\nTHIS WAS PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USER LARS MEIJER.\nNOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED.\nUpdate: Dutch Property Fund\nRatings Detail (as of August 15, 2025)\nDutch Property Fund\nIssuer Credit Rating\nA-/Negative/--\nIssuer Credit Ratings History\n10-Nov-2023\nA-/Negative/--\n08-Jul-2011\nA-/Stable/--\nRelated Entities\nDPF Finance B.V.\nSenior Unsecured\nA-\nUnless otherwise noted, all ratings in this report are global scale ratings.
