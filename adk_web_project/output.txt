hi

Hello, I am the Credit Pack orchestration agent. I will help you produce credit pack documents. Currently, the tools for deal analysis, requirements discovery, compliance checking, structure generation, and drafting are being connected.

Once the migration is complete, what would you like to do?

#3
ok

#4
Understood. I'm ready to assist once the tools are connected. I'll be here.

what can you do?

Once the tools are connected, I will be able to:

Analyze the deal: Understand the deal from provided information like a teaser, and determine the appropriate process path and origination method.
Discover requirements: Identify the dynamic requirements for the credit pack based on procedures and governance policies.
Check compliance: Assess the deal's compliance against relevant criteria.
Generate structure: Define the necessary sections for the credit pack document.
Draft sections: Write each section of the credit pack with the appropriate style and content.
Essentially, I will automate the process of creating a credit pack document from start to finish.
